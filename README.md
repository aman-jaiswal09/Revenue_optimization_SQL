#  Revenue Optimization

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes pizza store data to extract key business insights, including total orders, revenue generation, and pricing trends. Using SQL queries, we identify top-selling pizzas, revenue distribution, and customer order patterns.

##  Tools & Technologies Used
- SQL (Structured Query Language)
- Aggregation Functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `ROUND`)
- Joins (`INNER JOIN` for combining tables)
- Database Management System (DBMS)` (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)

##  Key Insights & Results
1. Total Orders: Extracted using `COUNT(order_id)`.
2. Total Revenue: Computed using `SUM(order_details.quantity * pizzas.price)`.
3. Highest-Priced Pizza: Identified using a `JOIN` between `pizza_types` and `pizzas`.
4. Top-Selling Pizza: Determined by aggregating sales data.
5. Order Frequency: Analyzed customer ordering patterns.
6. Revenue Breakdown: Sales distribution per pizza type.
7. Pricing Impact: Relationship between price and demand.
8. Menu Optimization: Data-driven insights for better product offerings.
9. Operational Efficiency: Optimizing inventory and pricing strategies.
10. Business Growth: Strategic recommendations for increased profitability.



##  How to run
1. Import the SQL file into your database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
2. Run the queries to generate insights.
3. Modify or extend queries as needed to explore additional business questions.

##  Future Enhancements
- Implement a visualization dashboard (using Python, Power BI, or Tableau).
- Automate reports with scheduled SQL scripts.
- Expand analysis with customer segmentation insights.
